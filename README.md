# RobotsAreNotYourFriend

This is a quick little MVP project I made to accompany a presentation that discussed the iterative flow I go through when I'm building an app from scratch.
The code is super simple and straightforward in order to present an unencumbered representation of this flow.
My hope is that someone new to development will be able to look at this (especially in conjunction with the slides from my presentation) and be able to see a method by which they might break a huge problem down into smaller steps.
